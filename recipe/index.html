<h2>You'll need...</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1/4 a cup of Dried Hibiscus Flowers</li>
    <li>3 Freshly cut Lemons</li>
    <li>1/2 White Sugar </li>
    <li>4 cups of Fresh Water</li>
    <li>An unquenchable thirst only lemonade can satisfy</li>
</ul></div>
<div>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
<ol><li>In a small pot, bring 1 cups of water to a rolling boil, and add the dried hibiscus flowers.The water will take on a crimson red color after a few moments. Allow the flower petals to soak and rehydrate. This should take no more then 5 minutes.</li>
<li> Next we're going to seperate the flowers from your extracted mixture.Have a fine mesh strainer over a heat safe container ready(I recommend doing this in your sink). Carefully lift your pot and pour the contents through the strainer, careful not to burn yourself!</li>
<li>Upon setting the rehydrated leaves aside, pour in your sugar to the warm mixture and stir! The heat will help your sugar evaporate quickly and more evenly. Set aside to cool.</li>
<li>While we allow the hibiscus portion to cool, lets get started on that lemonade! In a clean pitcher, add your 3 cups of fresh water and begin to squeeze in your lemon juice.</li>
<li>Once your hibiscus mixture has cooled, pour it into your lemonade and mix! Feel free to garnish with lemon slices or mint leaves.</li></ol>
